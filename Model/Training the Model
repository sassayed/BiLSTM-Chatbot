# The configuring the training process
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',metrics=['acc'],optimizer='adam')
# Categorical_crossentropy is often used for multi-class classification problems
# This is the ground truth or target output that your model is trying to learn (decoder_final_output)
model.fit([encoder_inp, decoder_inp],decoder_final_output,epochs=150)
# The model will go through the entire dataset 150 times during training.
# With using the "Fit" during each epoch,the model makes predictions on the input data and 
#computes the loss (the difference between the predictions and the actual targets)
#and then adjusts the model's weights to minimize this loss.
